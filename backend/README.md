# What is this folder?

This folder is the backend component of CRA ([/backend/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend#Backend_focused)), built with node js (express)

It's live on ðŸ‘‰ [CRA.TECH](https://www.crimestop-analytics.tech/)

# How can I contribute?

**We're using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for this project, do not use yarn for the following commands**

Compile @CRA/Backend by executing the following commands:

```bash
cd ../backend
npm
npm build
```

After you successfully compiled the backend, go back to this directory and install all modules

You should now be all set to go, go ahead and run the dev server

```bash
cd ../backend
npm
npm staging
```
