  <strong>A solution to the ongoing problem of crime and public safety</strong>
</p>

## About The Project

My motivation for taking up this project is to provide a new and innovative solution to the ongoing problem of crime and public safety in Jamaica, like many other countries, Jamaica is facing a rising crime rate that has left citizens feeling helpless. Traditional methods of identifying and tracking criminals have limitations and I believe that by using image recognition and other cutting-edge technologies, this project can make a meaningful impact on public safety
