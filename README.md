  <strong>A solution to the ongoing problem of crime and public safety</strong>
</p>

---

## About The Project
CrimeStop Analytics is a non-profit project aimed at providing innovative solutions to the ongoing problem of crime and public safety in Jamaica. Like many other countries, Jamaica is facing a rising crime rate that has left citizens feeling helpless. Traditional methods of identifying and tracking criminals have limitations and we believe that by using image recognition and other cutting-edge technologies, this project can make a meaningful impact on public safety.
